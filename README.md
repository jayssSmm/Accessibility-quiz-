# Day 9 – Accessibility Quiz (freeCodeCamp)

This project is part of my **#100DaysOfCode** and the **Responsive Web Design** certification from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## 📚 Project Overview
This project focused on making a simple quiz form that is **accessible** to everyone, including people who rely on:
- Screen readers
- Keyboard navigation
- Assistive technology

The goal was to structure HTML semantically using:
- Proper heading hierarchy
- `<label>` and `<input>` associations
- `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` tags
- `aria-*` attributes where appropriate

## 💡 What I Learned
- The importance of **semantic HTML** for accessibility
- How to use `aria-describedby`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-label`
- Why proper labeling improves UX for all users, not just those with disabilities
- How accessibility = inclusivity
